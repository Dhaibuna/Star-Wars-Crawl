    <p>
      After a first week to travel in the deep deep deep ...very deep depths of terminal and GitHub.
      Losing some files, folders and for some of them minds, the juniors of the promo Jepsen 4.27 
      lost themselves a little bit more with markdown. 
    </p>
    <p>
     Succeeding to this introduction to a brand new and hostile world, they had to deal with their first HTML & CSS
     pages. Their were mainly helped by two not really compliants friends : Flexbox & Grid. 
    </p>
    <p>
     Now our juniors have to face animations which include perspectives & 3d notions to which none of them payed attention 
     during their scholarship time...
